# True U.S. keyboard layout with German Umlauts
This layout is designed for German speakers using U.S. English mac keyboards. The layout is a modified U.S. English keyboard layout with German Umlauts using `⌥ option` key bindings:
* `option` + `a` => `ä`
* `option` + `o` => `ö`
* `option` + `u` => `ü`
* `option` + `s` => `ß`
* `option` + `shift` + `a` => `Ä`
* `option` + `shift` + `o` => `Ö`
* `option` + `shift` + `u` => `Ü`
* `option` + `shift` + `s` => `ẞ`

# Installation #
1. To install the keyboard layout open `Terminal` on your mac and execute the command below. 

```bash
curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/leonbeckert/us-with-german-umlauts/tarball/master | sudo tar xz --exclude=README.md --strip=1 -C /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
